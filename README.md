# Campus Emergency & Incident Intelligence System (CEIIS)

##  Project Description
The **Campus Emergency & Incident Intelligence System (CEIIS)** is a web-based application designed to provide a structured and secure platform for reporting, managing, and analyzing campus-related incidents. The system allows users to submit incident reports, automatically evaluates the risk level of each incident, and enables administrators to track and resolve incidents efficiently.

This project was developed strictly following the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. All system names and nomenclatures used during the design phase are consistently reflected in the implementation.

---

##  Project Objectives
- To enable structured reporting of campus incidents
- To automatically assess and classify incident risk levels
- To support administrators in monitoring and resolving incidents
- To improve campus safety through data-driven decision-making

---

##  System Modules (Design & Implementation Aligned)
1. **IncidentReporter** – Handles incident submission by users  
2. **IncidentDatabase** – Stores incident records persistently  
3. **RiskAssessmentEngine** – Automatically determines incident risk level  
4. **AdminDashboard** – Enables administrators to manage incidents  
5. **NotificationHandler** – Manages alerts and updates  
6. **IncidentAnalytics** – Provides incident statistics and insights  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Application structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Application logic  
- **JSON** – Data storage  
- **GitHub** – Version control and hosting

## 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1️⃣ Planning Phase
**Problem Identified:**  
Campus incidents are often underreported due to lack of anonymity, poor reporting structures, and delayed response mechanisms.

**Objective:**  
To design a system that enables fast, secure, and intelligent reporting and management of campus incidents.

**Scope:**  
- Web-based system  
- Campus-focused  
- Admin-controlled incident resolution

### 2️⃣ Requirements Analysis

#### Functional Requirements
- Users can submit incident reports
- System automatically assigns a risk level
- Admin can view and update incident status
- Incident data is stored persistently

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- User-friendly interface
- Fast response time
- Easy maintenance
- Secure admin access

---

### 3️⃣ System Design
The system follows a client-side web architecture where modules interact logically as shown below:
Data is structured and stored using JSON objects.

---

### 4️⃣ Implementation Phase
The system was implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON.  
Each module defined in the design phase was implemented using the same nomenclature to ensure design–implementation consistency.

Key implementation highlights:
- Incident submission form
- Automatic risk classification
- Admin dashboard for incident management
- Status tracking (Pending, In Progress, Resolved)

---

### 5️⃣ Testing Phase
The following tests were carried out:
- Form validation testing
- Risk level accuracy testing
- Admin dashboard functionality testing
- Data storage and retrieval testing

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment Phase
The project is deployed using **GitHub Pages**, making it accessible through a web browser. The repository is publicly available for academic review.

---

### 7️⃣ Maintenance Phase
Maintenance activities include:
- Bug fixes
- Feature enhancements
- Performance improvements
- Security updates

---

## ⚙️ System Features
- Campus incident reporting
- Automatic risk assessment
- Incident status tracking
- Administrative monitoring dashboard
